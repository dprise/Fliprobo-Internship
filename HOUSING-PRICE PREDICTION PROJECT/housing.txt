Housing prices are an important reflection of the economy, and housing price ranges are of great interest for both buyers and sellers. Housing price prediction can help the developer determine the selling price of a house and can help the customer to arrange the right time to purchase a house. There are three factors that influence the price of a house which include physical conditions, concept and location.

Our goal for this project is to build an end to end solution that would be capable of predicting the house prices better than individuals and also to understand the relationship between house features and how these variables are used to predict house price.
